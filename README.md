# Charmonium

Charmonium: adds ambient sound and additional music tracks to Minecraft.
It is a client-only mod and does **not** require [Charm](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm/) to be present on the server.
However, if Charm is available, then this mod gets a little smarter.

This is a **Fabric version** of Charmonium for Minecraft **1.17**.

If you are looking for the Forge version of Charmonium, it's in [this repository](https://github.com/svenhjol/CharmoniumForge/).
